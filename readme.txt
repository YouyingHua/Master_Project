LiDAR detection is susceptible to ambient interference. Therefore, it is important to maintain LiDAR detection performance when it operates autonomously in varying environments. 
Training the LiDAR performances in degraded environments by neural network (NN). Apply this NN model to optimize the initial point of ESC and use this model-guided ESC to optimize the LiDAR detection range to maintain a customized detection performance in different environments.
