Master Project (Lidar Automated Reconfiguration in Degraded Env)
Robotics Part

Platform: ROS
Node Program: C++ & Python
Sensor: LS02A

When LiDAR worked in degraded env, robot estimate the env by trained SVM model. According to Lidar ecpirical detection performance, robot moves to an optimal   detection range.
