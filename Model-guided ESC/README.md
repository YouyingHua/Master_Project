# LS02A

The laser radar can be implemented within the scope of 4 meters 90 degrees of two-dimensional planar scanning, produce the space plane point cloud map information used to sweep the floor in areas such as robot and robot vision system.

LS02A lidar structure by using light large field of view Angle of the rotating scanning function, at the same time range is realized by using triangle principle.Its principle is: LS02A diffraction lens line laser emitting 90 degrees, the laser signal produces reflection after exposure to the measured object surface, 90 degree reflected light through the optical lens by LS02A image acquisition processing system receives, made parameters.the lasers and laser emission line geometry triangle graphics, based on the triangle, after LS02A of real-time signal processing module, the target object with LS02A radar distance value, the other a Angle values, and to receive light intensity values will be output from the communication interface.
